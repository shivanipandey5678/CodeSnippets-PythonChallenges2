README
This repository contains Python scripts that solve various programming problems. Each script is labeled with a number, and here's a brief description of each:

Problem 4
This script takes an input tc (number of test cases) and for each test case, it finds and prints the unique element in an array.

Problem 5
Similar to Problem 4, this script also deals with finding the unique element in an array but for multiple test cases.

Problem 6
This script filters and prints the even numbers from a given array.

Problem 7
It finds and prints the maximum element in an array after sorting it.

Problem 8
Similar to Problem 7, this script finds and prints the maximum element in an array after sorting.

Problem 9
This script works with a 2D matrix, calculating the absolute difference between the sum of elements in specified regions.

Problem 10
It deals with a 2D matrix and prints the product of odd elements for each column.
